To get started I ran:
composer install

vagrant up

vagrant ssh

php artisan migrate

php db:seed

Then all of the routes defined in the api routes file should be hittable.

I did not get time to finish, so I haven't been able to test much. Nor did I try to implement the image upload feature.

Aside from that I think there is plenty here that demonstrates that I know how to put together an application in Laravel, I just did not get an opportunity to start working on this as early as I would have liked to and ran into issues with my environment.
